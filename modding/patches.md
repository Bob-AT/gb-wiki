## Creating a New Patch
Once you have followed the instructions to create a Staged Mod folder (see [quick-create](/modding/quick-create)), 

## Patch Image File Specification
* Create a 512x256 PNG file: `(Author)Name.png`. Spaces should be replaced with underscore (`_`).
* Optionaly create a 512x256 PNG file containing the normal map: `(Author)Name_N.png`
* Put the file(s) into `Documents/GroundBranch/StagedMod/GroundBranch/Patches/<CATEGORY>/`.
* `<CATEGORY>` can be one of the existing ones ("BloodType", "Country", "Morale", "Role") or you can invent a new category.
